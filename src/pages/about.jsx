                Founded in 1904 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis as the Society of Hammer and Tongs by four engineering students, Theta Tau is the oldest, largest, and foremost Fraternity for Engineers. Today, Theta Tau proudly has a diverse membership of men and women studying engineering and computer science at more than 80 campuses across the US.

                In Spring of 2018, Mark Muendelein met a handful of brothers from Epsilon Delta Chapter of Theta
                Tau, chartered at University of California, San Diego. It was the same Spring he met the Theta Tau brothers
                that he finished his term as the Vice President of Alumni Relations with Alpha Kappa Psi. By the end of the
                semester, he had realized that his community and his career were destined for two different directions. In
                an attempt to bridge this gap he saw, Muendelein decided to enlist friends, peers, colleagues, and mentors
                to begin a chapter of Theta Tau at San Jose State University.

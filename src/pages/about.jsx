        Founded in 1904 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis as the Society of Hammer and Tongs by four
        engineering students, Theta Tau is the oldest, largest, and foremost Fraternity for Engineers. Today, Theta Tau
        proudly has a diverse membership of men and women studying engineering and computer science at more than 80
        campuses across the US.

        In Spring of 2018, Mark Muendelein met a handful of brothers from Epsilon Delta Chapter of Theta Tau, chartered
        at University of California, San Diego. It was the same Spring he met the Theta Tau brothers that he finished
        his term as the Vice President of Alumni Relations with Alpha Kappa Psi. By the end of the semester, he had
        realized that his community and his career were destined for two different directions. In an attempt to bridge
        this gap he saw, Muendelein decided to enlist friends, peers, colleagues, and mentors to begin a chapter of
        Theta Tau at San Jose State University.
